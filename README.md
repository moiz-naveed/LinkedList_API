**This program consists of a Linked List API and a simple traffic simulation to test the functionality of the API.**

The program simulates a single 4 way intersection with each incoming lane described as a linkedlist. 
As cars approach the intersection, they are added to the linked list. As cars leave the intersection,
they are removed from the list.

text.txt includes the input for the intersection.

After typing "make" and using the make file to compile both the program and the test main,
bin/runMe <filename.txt> should execute the program.

testmain should work with bin/testMe. 
No file is needed for the testmain although print and compare functions need to be defined.
